                  <p>My name is Angelo Luigi De Jesus Cruz. Originally from the Bay Area, but currently located in San Diego, CA. I have worked in the Biotech industry since graduating from San Francisco State University. My work experience includes roles in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Quality Assurance at companies: Novartis, Genentech, and Gilead. Pursuing web development has always been a goal for me. I look forward to learning and working with my cohort at the UCSD Ext Coding Bootcamp.</p>
                  <p class="mb-0">Some of my favorite hobbies include traveling and watching sports. For my next travel destination, I would really like to visit Japan.</p>
